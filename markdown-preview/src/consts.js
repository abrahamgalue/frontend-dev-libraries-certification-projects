Here's some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and

------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.
